# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The goal of this analysis is to solidify the proposal for investors and convice them that a bike-sharing program in Des moine is a solid business proposal. 
For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype and converted datatype as seen below. 

!['tripduration'%20column%20to%20datetime](https://github.com/cbrito3/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualization/'tripduration'%20column%20to%20datetime.png)

!['datatypes%20of%20your%20columns](https://github.com/cbrito3/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualization/datatypes%20of%20your%20columns.png)


Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
This first visualization shows the length of time of every bike ride during the month of August in 2019. This information allows us to see that riders typically like to bike between 2 and 15 minutes.

This second visualization shows the breakdown of riders by gender and duration of times. This shows that most of the users are men.

This third visualization shows user trips by weekdday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.. This shows that from a weekday perspective trips are most common on Thursdays afternoon between 5pm and 6pm.  

!['Trips%20by%20Weekday%20Per%20Hour%20](https://github.com/cbrito3/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualization/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20Per%20Hour%20.png)

This forth visualization shows trips by gender (Weekday per Hour), the graph is the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. This shows that the most common user are male subscribers and from a weekday perspective they frequently ride bikes on Thursdays in the afternoon between 5pm and 6pm.

This fifth visualization shows user trips by gender by Weekday. In this visualization, the heatmap  shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
