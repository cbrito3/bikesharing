## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The goal of this analysis is to solidify the proposal for investors and convice them that a bike-sharing program in Des moine is a solid business proposal. 
For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
